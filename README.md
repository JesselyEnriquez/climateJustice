In their own words:

*Following the 7.8 Mw Gorkha Earthquake on April 25, 2015, Nepal carried out a massive household survey using mobile technology to assess building damage in the earthquake-affected districts. Although the primary goal of this survey was to identify beneficiaries eligible for government assistance for housing reconstruction, it also collected other useful socio-economic information. In addition to housing reconstruction, this data serves a wide range of uses and users e.g. researchers, newly formed local governments, and citizens at large. The purpose of this portal is to open this data to the public.*

Data Source: 

[2015 Nepal Earthquake Open Data Portal](http://eq2015.npc.gov.np/#/)
Information of Building Structure, Ownership, and Damage Assessment is provided and easily accesible via the portal for each building in surveyed post the Gorka Earthquake in 2015. 

Kathmandu Living Labs designed and developed the 2015 Nepal Earthquake: Open Data Portal, with guidance from Central Bureau of Statistics and National Planning Commission, and support received as part of DFIDâ€™s Evidence for Development Programme implemented by The Asia Foundation and Development Initiatives.

- Dhading
- Dolakha
- Gorkha
- Kaverpalanchok
- Makwanpur
- Nuwakot
- Okhaldhunga
