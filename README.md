In their own words:

*Following the 7.8 Mw Gorkha Earthquake on April 25, 2015, Nepal carried out a massive household survey using mobile technology to assess building damage in the earthquake-affected districts. Although the primary goal of this survey was to identify beneficiaries eligible for government assistance for housing reconstruction, it also collected other useful socio-economic information. In addition to housing reconstruction, this data serves a wide range of uses and users e.g. researchers, newly formed local governments, and citizens at large. The purpose of this portal is to open this data to the public.*

Data Source: 

[2015 Nepal Earthquake Open Data Portal](http://eq2015.npc.gov.np/#/)
Information of Building Structure, Ownership, and Damage Assessment is provided and easily accesible via the portal for each building in surveyed post the Gorka Earthquake in 2015.
