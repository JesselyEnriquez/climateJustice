prevalent# Earthquake Damage Modeling
---

## Executive Summary

The project to model and predict earthquake damage in Nepal came in part because of the tragic earthquake named Gorka that occured April 25, 2015 in Nepal. The project aims to support and classify the damage a building is expected to endure given an event with a similar magnitude occurs, in order to inform Nepali locals if retrofitting of a particular building is needed. The research and modeling was done for approximately 11 districts in Nepal. The model can predict and classify the expected damage of a building with an accuracy and F1 Score (micro) of 66%. Considering the baseline percentage for this dataset was 36% this model provides a considerable advantage for the government to accurately determine buildings at risk. </br>

## Problem Statement
In Nepal there is a need to evaluate where to focus preventative funding but also locals who are knowledgeful of how to retrofit their communities. A model to shed some insight as to what buildings are in need of retrofitting could allow locals to asses if there were any buildings overlooked when undergoing reconstructions from the 2015 Gorkha Earthquake. 

## Data Collection
From the [2015 Nepal Earthquake Open Data Portal](http://eq2015.npc.gov.np/#/)
In their own words:

*Following the 7.8 Mw Gorkha Earthquake on April 25, 2015, Nepal carried out a massive household survey using mobile technology to assess building damage in the earthquake-affected districts. Although the primary goal of this survey was to identify beneficiaries eligible for government assistance for housing reconstruction, it also collected other useful socio-economic information. In addition to housing reconstruction, this data serves a wide range of uses and users e.g. researchers, newly formed local governments, and citizens at large. The purpose of this portal is to open this data to the public.*

Information of Building Structure, Ownership, and Damage Assessment is provided and easily accessible via the portal for each building in surveyed post the Gorka Earthquake in 2015.

Kathmandu Living Labs designed and developed the 2015 Nepal Earthquake: Open Data Portal, with guidance from Central Bureau of Statistics and National Planning Commission, and support received as part of DFIDâ€™s Evidence for Development Program implemented by The Asia Foundation and Development Initiatives.

The damage assessment will be modeled for all eleven districts of Nepal those are named as the following:
- Dhading
- Dolakha
- Gorkha
- Kaverpalanchok
- Makwanpur
- Nuwakot
- Okhaldhunga
- Ramechhap
- Rasuwa
- Sindhuli
- Sindhupalchok

## Modeling
A variety of different models and approaches were attempted working through modeling iterations. The different classifier models used in the project were  Random Forest, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression.

After many iterations, the model that performed best based on the F1 Score(micro), since it was a multi-class target with severely imbalanced classes of building damage was the Logistic Regression Classifier with only minor changes to the default parameters. The feature importances were explored to compare among models, these summaries can be found in the presentation.

The inputs that ultimately were of importance to can be summarized as a form to represent location, age of a building, and buildings structure conditions.

## Conclusion


The final model is able to predict the level of damage a building is expected to experience far more effectively than the baseline. The factors that seem to have the most impact are  location, age of a building, and building structure conditions.  <br>


The Nepali government, as well as locals that the volunteers to survey can utilize this model to attempt to evaluate the expected damage if another earthquake of that magniture were to occur. Given that this was data from a fairly significant earthquake these damage levels is considered a conservative predictions since earthquakes on this scale are not extremely prevelant in Nepal.

## Future Work
Gathering a form of geographical summary of the spacial characteristics on the smallest level possible for each municipality to include sounds to be a good approach to gather a more accurate representation that just the municipality IDs and other spatial IDs that the model is attempting to create connections to damage with.

Once that is made, assuming this is possible on a large scale then the model can be expanded to and even larger scale given that these geospatial representation values actually improve the models performance.

 ## Data Dictionary
These features were compiled from a third party source ([Data Driven](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/57/nepal-earthquake/)) since the original data source did not describe all features in their portal.
